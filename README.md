# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is "Too high," "Too low," or "Congratulations" if the guess is correct. The game also limits the number of attempts and shows a "Game Over" message if the attempts are exhausted.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- Input box for user guesses.
- Feedback messages based on the user's guess.
- 10 attempts per game.
- Option to restart the game after a correct guess or game over.
